The Ultimate Love Reality Check Machine™
💘 Welcome to the most chaotic, unpredictable, and brutally honest love calculator on the internet! This isn’t just some basic "percentage" love calculator—oh no, we’re going ALL IN. From FLAMES to Red Flag Alerts to Love Speedruns, your relationship will be tested, roasted, and possibly obliterated.

🎮 How It Works

FLAMES Game – Start by entering your name and your partner’s name. My system will run the sacred FLAMES ritual to determine if you’re destined for love, friendship, or… well, eternal rivalry. (Spoiler: The results are 100% accurate. Trust the science.)

AI Horoscope Prediction – What do the stars say about your love life? Enter your zodiac signs and let our questionable AI generate a highly scientific compatibility reading. (Warning: May cause existential crisis.)

Red Flag or Green Flag Test 🚦 – Answer a series of weird and ridiculous relationship questions. With every 🚩red flag, the system will silently judge you. If your Green Flag score is high, congrats! If not… we have some concerns.

Love Speedrun Timer ⏳ – How long will your relationship last? 100 years? 50 years? 5 seconds? Watch as your love story unfolds in real-time, with hilarious random events reducing (or extending) your love life expectancy. (Cause of death: Forgot anniversary. Game over.)

 Final Love Report 📜 – At the end, my system will generate an official relationship verdict based on your test results. Will you be soulmates or a walking disaster? Find out!
